In the growing age of Internet with the technology like IoT, Cloud Computing, and Big
Data, phishing websites is the severe problem of Internet that intended the human vulnerabilities
instead of targeting system vulnerabilities. It is a method to attract online users to get their sensitive
credentials and lead to financial loss. In the paper, we proposed a lexical based machine learning
approach to detect the phishing URL in a real-time environment. For the best performance in
classification, we have selected the Random Forest technique. We use ISCXURL-2016 data set for
the experimental analysis. We have used 19964 instances of legitimate and phishing URLs for
evaluation. Our proposed approach uses nine feature sets and has obtained a high accuracy of
around 99.57% with low false positive rate of 0.3%. Obtained results clearly show that the proposed
approach performs better than existing approaches.
